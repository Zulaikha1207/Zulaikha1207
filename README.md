- 🔭 I’m currently working as an MLOps & AI intern at IBM CIC Gronigen, NL. Previous to this, I completed my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University if Groningen. My thesis was about understanding the effects of meditation and positive rumination on individuals suffering from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). I used machine learning and reservior computing for this.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to deploy machine learning models using MLOps concepts and tools. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on AI/ML projects 
- 💬 Ask me about MLOps!
- In my free time I love dancing, I like to to go out 🌤️, bouldering 🧗‍♂️, play the piano 🎹, paint 👩‍🎨 and play outdoor games!
